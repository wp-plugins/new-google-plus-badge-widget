This plugin allows you to quickly and easily add the new Google Plus badge widget to your blog running WordPress.

== Description ==

Google Plus has a new badge widget that is available for use. Released along with their recent restructuring and rebranding, the badge features a photo tile mosaic, along with a profile picture, name, link, description, and Google Plus "Follow" button along with a follower count.

This badge widget provides significant enhancements over the traditional badge widget, both in terms of functionality and aesthetics. However, the code normally must be added manually, until now.

This plugin allows you to quickly and easily add the new Google Plus badge widget to your website, assuming it is running the WordPress content management system. It is easy to configure using your Google Plus user ID, and it is able to be styled using CSS to fit your blog's current WordPress theme.
